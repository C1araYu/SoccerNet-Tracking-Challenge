### DL-Assisted-Referee: Kuai Yu (ky2589), Ziwei Wang (zw2915), Emily Wang (eaw2233)

This project includes two different implementations of the task: a modified SoccerNet-Tracking-Challenge ByteTrack baseline, as well as a version of SoccerNet's Game State Reconstruction Challenge baseline, enhanced with domain knowledge to optimize Tracking performance.  

The SoccerNet Tracking Challenge involves detecting bounding boxes for objects from live broadcast footage of soccer games, as well as assigning consistent tracklet IDs for objects moving in and out of frame.

## How to run code

### ByteTrack Implementation:

PYTHONPATH=~/ByteTrack_Implementation/ByteTrack_HOME:$PYTHONPATH bash run_bytetrack_no_gt_batch.sh
